# Data-Frame-Library-for-Java
A Java-based data frame library designed to provide intuitive and efficient data manipulation capabilities similar to R and pandas within the Java ecosystem. This project covers core data frame functionalities, including data storage, manipulation, and basic statistical analysis methods.

# Java DataFrame Library

## Overview

This project introduces a Java DataFrame library aimed at simplifying data manipulation and analysis in Java, inspired by the functionality found in Python's pandas and R's data frame. It provides an intuitive API for handling tabular data, supporting operations such as reading, writing, filtering, summarizing, and plotting data.

## Features

- **Core DataFrame Operations**: `DataFrame.java` offers the foundation for creating and manipulating tabular data structures.
- **Data Vector Manipulation**: `DataVector.java` and `DoubleDataVector.java` for handling columns of data, supporting generic and double-specific operations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: `DataFrameStatistics.java` extends the library's capabilities with methods for performing basic statistical analysis.
- **Data Plotting (Partial Implementation)**: `DataFramePlotting.java` aims to provide visualization tools directly in Java (Note: This extension is partially implemented and may require further contributions to reach full functionality).
- **Type-Specific Data Frames**: `DoubleDataFrame.java` caters to data frames specifically designed to hold double precision floating-point numbers, optimizing performance for numerical analysis.
- **Utility Classes**: `RandomTools.java` and `FileTools.java` for generating random data and handling file input/output operations, enhancing the library's usability in real-world scenarios.
- **Example Usage**: `MainTesting.java` demonstrates how to utilize the library with practical examples.

## Getting Started

```java
// Include the library in your project
import your.package.DataFrame;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a new DataFrame
        DataFrame df = new DataFrame();

        // Populate and manipulate the DataFrame
    }
}
